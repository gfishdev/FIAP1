    July 22, 1999

    To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD:

    As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") source
    code files require that further distributions of products containing all or
    portions of the software, acknowledge within their advertising materials
    that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its
    contributors.

    Specifically, the provision reads:

    "     * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this
               software
          *	   must display the following acknowledgement:
          *	   This product includes software developed by the University of
          *	   California, Berkeley and its contributors."

    Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to
    include the acknowledgement within advertising materials. Accordingly, the
    foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
    in its entirety.
